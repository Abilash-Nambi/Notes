--> How data is stored
Stores data in tables
Columns
Rows

-->Relational Database 
it is called relational database because two ore more tables have some kind of ralationship between them.

-->Psql is an Object-relational database management system\

-->password --> 12345 port --> 5432

-->connect to database 
1.Gui client
2.Terminal or command line.
3.Application

.\c test(databsename) -->for connecting in 

-->CREATE DATABASE test; 
for creating new Database

-->DROP DATABASE test;
for deleteing database


-->Create tables 

- CREATE TABLE table name (
     Column name + data type + constraints if any.
  )

  eg:
    CREATE TABLE person (
        id int,
        first name VARCHAR (50),
        last name VARCHAR (50),
        gender VARCHAR(6),
        date of birth Date,
   )

-\d - to show all tables in database
- \d person ->we will get the details of person Table

-->Creating tables with constraints

CREATE TABLE person (
    id BIGSERIAL NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    first name VARCHAR (50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR (50) NOT NULL,
    gender VARCHAR (5) NOT NULL,
    date of birth DATE NOT NULL,
)

-->Id actually uniquely identifying a data in actual table

-->DROP TABLE person --> Deletes the table person

-->BIGSERIAL is an auto increment number.so we dont have to keep on remembering the previous number

-->How to insert records into tables

INSERT INTO person (
    first_name,
    last_name,
    gender,
    test date of birth)
    VALUES ('Anne', 'Smith', 'FEMALE' DATE 1988-01-09'
);

-\dt for showing only tables not sequece

-\i /Users/HP/Downloads/person2.sql (path of folder) --> to 
-SELECT * FROM person -> read every records from table person
-SELECT FROM person ->it actually shows the number of rows present in table person. dont show the data
-SELECT first_name from person ->shows only first name
-SELECT first_name,last_name from person ->shows only first name

-ORDER BY ->for sorting
-select * from person2 order by country_of_birth; it will sort in ascending order.
-select * from person2 order by country_of_birth desc ->for descending order.

-Distinct ->for getting the Distinct VALUES. or avoinding the duplicates datas . 
-select distinct country_of_birth from person2 order by country_of_birth

-where ->filter data based on conditions.
-select * from person2 where country_of_birth='india';
-select * from person2 where gender = 'Male' and (country_of_birth = 'Poland' or country_of_birth = 'usa');
-select * from person2 where gender = 'Male' and (country_of_birth = 'Poland' or country_of_birth = 'China') and first_name = 'Brose';

-Comparison Operators
-select 1=1
   t;(true)
-select 1<>2 (not equel to)
 t

 -LIMIT, OFFSET, AND FETCH 
 -select * from person2 limit 10 ->shows first 10 data
 -select * from person2 offset 5 limit 5; ->skip first 5 and then limit the data to 5.
 -select * from person2 fetch first 1 row only ->show only first 1 data.(same as limit)

 -IN
 -select * from person2 where country_of_birth in ('China','Poland');

 -Between ->to select a data from a range
 -select * from person2 where date_of_birth between date '2024/01/01' and '2024/01/30';

 -LIKE AND ILIKE -> 
-select * from person2 where email like '%.fr'; gives the data which is ending with .fr
-select * from person2 where email like '%google.%'; give the data where anywhere google. is present
-select * from person2 where email like 'P% ->starting with P
-select * from person2 where email ilike 'p% ->starting with P (case senstive)

Group BY
-select country_of_birth, count(*) from person2 group by country_of_birth order by country_of_birth;

         country_of_birth         | count
----------------------------------+-------
 Afghanistan                      |     4
 Albania                          |     4
 American Samoa                   |     1
 Bahamas                          |     1
 Bangladesh                       |     4
      
-HAVE ->For doing an extra filter
-select country_of_birth,count(*) from person2 group by country_of_birth having count(*) >12 order by country_of_birth;

Calculating Min, Max & Average,sum
- select max(price) from car1;
- select min(price) from car1;
- select avg(price) from car1;
- select round(avg(price)) from car1;
- select make, min(price) from car1 group by make order by make;
- select sum(price) from car1;
- SELECT make,SUM(price) FROM car1 GROUP BY make ORDER BY make;

ARITHMETIC Operators
- select 10 + 2;
- select 10 - 2;
- select 10 * 2;
- select 10 / 2;
- select 10 ^ 2; (power of )
- select 10!; factorial
- select 10 % 3; gives reminder VALUE;
-  select id,make,model,price, round(price * .10,2) from car1; here 2 is how many decimal places. example 
test=# select id,make,model,price, round(price * .10,2) from car1;

  id  |     make      |          model          |   price   |  round
------+---------------+-------------------------+-----------+----------
    1 | Saab          | 900                     | 604045.00 | 60404.50
    2 | Mazda         | Protege                 |  94369.00 |  9436.90

- select id,make,model,price, round(price * .10,2),round(price - price * .10,2) from car1;

  id  |     make      |          model          |   price   |  round   |   round
------+---------------+-------------------------+-----------+----------+-----------
    1 | Saab          | 900                     | 604045.00 | 60404.50 | 543640.50
    2 | Mazda         | Protege                 |  94369.00 |  9436.90 |  84932.10

- Here is round is the column name because if we dont specify any column name then it will give function name for Columns
- we can use the alias keyword for overwriting any column,using as
- select id,make,model,price as original_price, round(price * .10,2) as percentage,round(price - price * .10,2) as after_offer from car1;

Coalesce
- allows us to have default value in case if first one is not present.
- select coalesce(1); output is 1.
- select coalesce(null,1); here first one is null, so it gives the one.
- select coalesce(null,null,1); if first is null,take second val,if that is null take third and so on..
- select coalesce(null,null,1,10); it will take the first value there. so here is 1.
- select id,first_name,last_name,coalesce(email,'not provided') from person2;

Nullif
- if both values are same it will gives nothing.
- if both are diff then it gives first argument
- select nullif(10,10) - nothing will give;
- select nullif(100,66) - it will give 100.

Timestamp and date

- select now(); ->Timestamp
- select now()::date;
- select now()::time;

Adding and substracting with dates.

- select now() - interval '1 year'
- select now() - interval '10 months'
- select now() - interval '10 days'
- select now() + interval '10 days;
- select now()::date + interval '10 days; here we will get the date.
- select (now() + interval '10 days)::date; - we will get the date only not time(00:00:00)

extracting fields

- select extract(year from now())
- select extract(day from now())
- select extract(dow from now()) -day of week - sunday-0,monday-1;
- selcet first_name,date_of_birth,age(now(),date_of_birth) as age from person2
PRIMARY KEY

- primary key is a value which uniquely identifies a record in the table
- ALTER TABLE car1 DROP CONSTRAINT car1_pkey; -> for removing the primary key;
- ALTER TABLE car1 ADD PRIMARY KEY(id) -> for adding primarykey. here primary key is taking arary of values . (if need to add primary key to 
  multiple columns then we can use like PRIMARY KEY(ID,first_name,last_name))
- DELETE FROM car1 where id = 1; ->For deleteing the id = 1;
- unique constraints is used to confirm that each column have unique values.
- alter table person2 add constraint unique_email unique(email);
- alter table person2 drop constraint unique_email
- alter table person2 add unique(email) ->another way of adding unique constraint;here constraint name given by psql

check constraint;

-ALTER TABLE person2 ADD CONSTRAINT gender_constraint CHECK (gender = 'Female' OR gender = 'Male') ->here 
 when we add a record then it should be either Male or Female

Delete record;

- Delete from person2 ->every thing will get deleted
- delete from person2 where id == 3;
- delete from person2 where gender = 'male' and  country_of_birth = 'Poland';

update record;
- update person set email = 'alan@gmail.com' ->every emai will get update with this email
- update person set email = 'alan@gmail.com' where id= 34;
- update person set first_name = 'jithin',last_name='chacko' where id = 356;

On conflict

- insert into person2 (first_name, last_name, email, gender, date_of_birth, country_of_birth)
  values ('Loria', 'Overstreet', 'loverstreet0@blogtalkradio.com', 'Female', '2018-12-30', 'United Kingdom')
  on conflict(email) do nothing;
  this will work if the thing we pass inside on conflict will be either primary key or unique key, it will work with multiple columns.
- insert into person2 (first_name, last_name, email, gender, date_of_birth, country_of_birth)
  values ('Loria', 'Overstreet', 'loverstreet0@blogtalkradio.com', 'Female', '2018-12-30', 'United Kingdom')
  on conflict(email) do update email = excluded.email , last_name = excluded.last_name; 
  Here the value will update from the exculuded one(which is not taken here)

Foreign key relationship

- create table person3 (
	id BIGSERIAL NOT NULL,
	first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
	last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
	email VARCHAR(50),
	gender VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
	date_of_birth DATE NOT NULL,
	country_of_birth VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
	car_id BIGINT REFERENCES car3(id),UNIQUE(car_id)
);
- update person3 set car_id = 10 where id = 4;

Inner joins
- it actually a way to combining two tables.
- select * from person3 join car3 on person3.car_id = car3.id;
- select person3.first_name,person3.gender,car3.make,car3.price from person3 join car3 on person3.car_id = car3.id;
- select person3.first_name,person3.gender,car3.make,car3.price from person3 join car3 on person3.car_id = car3.id where car.* = null;
  here it gives that null one which have no REFERENCES

LEft joins
- select * from person3 left join car3 on person3.car_id = car3.id;

if a colums is REFERENCEd then it cant be dleted. for example two tables A and B here
